Students' Convenience Portal - We have initiated our project with a login and sign up page for our college students and a login page for the teachers which are registered. Then further, we will link various pages such as poll page for mess menu every week, online attendance provision for reviewing real-time weekly attendance in various courses, online application for NOC so that students wont have to run in their respectives departments and dean academic for the signatures and for getting scholarship forms signed by the concerned authorities. In the end, there is a contact us page.
